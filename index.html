    <p>A Gothic Tale</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Chapter One: The Curiosity of Gabriel Attal</h2>
    <p>Gabriel Attal was not a man easily captivated. Raised among the grind of politics, he had long learned to shield himself from anything too extraordinary, anything that could distract him from his ambition. He was sharp, calculated, and his ascent in the French political world had been marked by his charm and ability to navigate public opinion with ease. Yet, beneath his well-honed exterior, there was something more—a hunger for truth that went beyond speeches and policy.</p>

    <p>It was this hunger, this quiet curiosity, that led him to the story of Edward Scissorhands.</p>

    <p>The rumors had swirled for years, whispered among the political elite and forgotten artists alike: a man, or rather a creation, living in isolation just outside Paris, with blades for hands. The tale seemed like something out of a gothic novel, a strange oddity—a tragedy wrapped in mystery. Gabriel first heard about Edward during a dinner with a journalist, Kim. She had mentioned him offhandedly, as one does when referring to the outlandish, a kind of footnote in a conversation about society’s forgotten figures.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "He's real, you know," Kim had said, swirling her wine glass.  
      "Edward Scissorhands. Lives in a mansion on the outskirts of the city. People say he’s an artist. He cuts flowers, carves sculptures. Beautiful things. But no one ever sees him. Only a few brave souls who venture out there."
    </blockquote>

    <p>At first, Gabriel had been skeptical, dismissing it as the kind of sensationalism he was used to in the media. But the idea of this strange man—trapped by his own existence—lingered in his mind...</p>

    <h2>Chapter Two: The Mansion in the Woods</h2>
    <p>The mansion was nothing like Gabriel had expected. It was vast and intimidating, a crumbling relic from another time. The trees surrounding it seemed to reach out like silent sentinels, their bare branches casting long shadows on the ground. The air felt different here, colder, more still. Gabriel’s heart beat just a little faster as he approached the front door.</p>

    <p>He knocked twice, the sound echoing through the empty yard. The door opened slowly, revealing Edward—a tall figure standing in the threshold, bathed in dim light...</p>

    <h2>Chapter Three: The World of Edward Scissorhands</h2>
    <p>The inside of the mansion was much like its exterior—grand but worn, with an air of neglect and abandonment. Yet, as Gabriel stepped inside, he couldn’t help but notice the small details: the carefully placed sculptures, the delicate carvings on the walls, the artistry in every corner of the house...</p>

    <p>“Do you ever show your work to others?” Gabriel asked as they walked through the rooms, his fingers brushing over the smooth edges of an intricately carved chair.</p>

    <p>Edward shrugged. “No one ever comes. People don’t want to see me. They only want to be afraid of me. Or pity me.”</p>

    <p>Gabriel studied Edward for a long moment. There was a vulnerability to him, a quiet sadness that Gabriel hadn’t expected...</p>

    <h2>Chapter Four: The Weight of the World</h2>
    <p>Over the weeks that followed, Gabriel found himself returning to the mansion more often than he had intended. What had begun as a study in curiosity grew into something deeper—an unspoken companionship, fragile and strange...</p>

    <p>They spoke about everything: about loneliness, about creation, about the strange balance between beauty and pain. Gabriel confessed how politics had begun to hollow him out, how his life had become a performance of ideals he no longer believed in...</p>

    <p>Sometimes they didn’t speak at all. They would walk through the garden, through rows of sculptures Edward had shaped from overgrown hedges—animals, faces, fragments of emotion frozen in leaves...</p>

    <p>Yet the outside world crept closer. Kim had noticed Gabriel’s absence, his growing detachment from the bustle of Parisian life. One evening, she confronted him.  
    “You’ve changed,” she said. “You disappear for hours. You’re distracted in meetings. What are you hiding out there?”</p>

    <p>Gabriel hesitated. “Someone you should meet
